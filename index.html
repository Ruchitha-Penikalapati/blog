    <p>You guys… where do I even start?! WE ARE PARENTS!!!! I’m crying as I type this because it still doesn’t feel real
        that we are sharing this with you all. We’ve been keeping this little man a secret for a while now & what a
        beautiful little secret he is. Our baby boy was born February 6th & weighed 7 pounds 8 ounces. We became parents
        that day thank you to one of the most amazing, strong, smart, & selfless women we have ever met who gave birth
        to the most beautiful little boy & made us mom & dad. We can never thank her enough, but we will try every
        single day by the way we love this little man. I never ever ever ever knew that adoption could be this beautiful
        & that there would be so much love involved all around.
